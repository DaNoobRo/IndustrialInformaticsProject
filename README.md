## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- A computer

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Setup your ssh key

    https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone ssh-or-https-link
```
    
Create your own branch for the features that you are working on (at least regarding the coding part)

```bash
git checkout -b "the-name-of-your-branch"
```

When finished, push the files and create a pull request

```bash
git status
git add "filename"
git add .
git commit -m "your message here"
git push 
```
- https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request - also add the other team members as reviewers 

### Style test

Checks if the best practices and the right coding style has been used.

- Write clean code!

## Deployment

I will come back with instructions for that.
